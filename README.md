## Projects

### Housing Price Valuation Model
OLS regression examining the determinants of housing prices.  
Includes log transformations, robust standard errors, and joint hypothesis testing.

### Cobb-Douglas Production Function
Estimation of a Cobb-Douglas production function using log-linear OLS.  
Includes joint significance testing and a test for constant returns to scale.
