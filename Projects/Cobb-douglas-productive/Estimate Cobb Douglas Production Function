A.)To estimate the Cobb-Douglas production function, we need to linearize it so that we can apply the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. 

1.We write the general form of the Cobb-Douglas production function

Q = A K^α L^β E^γ M^δ

2. Then, we take natural log on every component in our regression line:


ln(Q) = ln(A) + α ln(K) + β ln(L) + γ ln(E) + δ ln(M)

3. We could set up the regression line by using ln(Q) as our dependent variable

ln(Q) = β₀ + β₁ ln(K) + β₂ ln(L) + β₃ ln(E) + β₄ ln(M)

To find the regression line, we first generate variables equal to natural log.
Code:
gen lnq=ln(q)
gen lnk=ln(k)
gen lnl=ln(l)
gen lnm=ln(m)
gen lne=ln(e)
