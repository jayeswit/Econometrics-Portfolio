# Cobb-Douglas Production Function (OLS, STATA)

## Objective
Estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function using log-linear OLS and test (1) joint significance of inputs and (2) constant returns to scale.

## Model
ln(Q) = ln(A) + α ln(K) + β ln(L) + γ ln(E) + δ ln(M) + u

### Methods

- Log-linear transformation of Cobb-Douglas production function
- OLS estimation with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors
- Joint F-test of input significance
- Test of Constant Returns to Scale (α + β + γ + δ = 1)
- Economic interpretation of output elasticities

# Cobb-Douglas Production Function

## Part A – Model Setup
Explain theory and log-linearization.

## Part B – Estimation
Regression results table.

## Part C – Hypothesis Testing
Joint significance test, returns to scale test.

## Part D – Economic Interpretation and Returns to Scale Analysis
Economic meaning of coefficients.

## Key Takeaways

- Materials input (lnM) is highly statistically significant and exhibits the strongest output elasticity.
- Labor and capital contribute positively but with smaller marginal effects.
- Joint hypothesis testing confirms that materials and energy are jointly important production inputs.
- The constant returns to scale test fails to reject, suggesting the firm operates under approximately constant returns to scale.
- Results are consistent with standard production theory.
