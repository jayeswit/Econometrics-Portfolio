# Housing Price Valuation Model

## Objective

Estimate the determinants of housing prices using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and evaluate statistical and economic significance of key variables.

---

## Model Specification

The baseline model estimated is:

price = β₀ + β₁(size) + β₂(bedrooms) + β₃(bathrooms) + β₄(distance_cbd) + β₅(interstate_access) + u

A log transformation of price is also estimated to interpret coefficients as approximate percentage effects.

## Methods

- OLS regression with robust standard errors  
- Log transformation of dependent variable  
- Joint hypothesis testing of structural characteristics  

---

## Key Findings

- Property size has a positive and statistically significant effect on price.  
- Bathrooms tend to have a stronger marginal impact than bedrooms.  
- Distance from the central business district negatively affects price.  
- Structural characteristics are jointly significant.
